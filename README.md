- Fork the project:
  Click the gray `Fork` button in the top right of this page. This creates _your_ copy of the project and saves it as a new repository in your github account

- Click on the green `Code` button, then either the HTTPS or SSH option and, click the icon to copy the URL. Now you have a copy of the project. Thus, you can play around with it locally on your computer.

- Run the following commands into a terminal window (Command Prompt, Powershell, Terminal, Bash, ZSH). Do this to download the forked copy of this repository to your computer.

  cd hacktoberfest-practice
```

- Make a new branch. Your username would make a good branch because it's unique.

```

- Open the `Add your name and technologies you are interested in.md` file

- **Add your name to the section that matches your Initial in [this list](https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/hacktoberfest-practice#hacktoberfest-community). Then, add your name in alphabetical order. Then save your changes.**
